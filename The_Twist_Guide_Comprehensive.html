    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the comprehensive guide for "The Twist." This detailed walkthrough provides all the information you need to progress through the game, highlighting specific interaction points, score requirements, and outcomes. Whether you're just starting your journey or looking to maximize your relationships with specific characters, this guide will help you navigate through the game efficiently.</p>
    
    <p>The guide is organized by game versions and character relationship progression, with each section detailing the specific time requirements, character interactions, item needs, and special conditions necessary to progress. By following this guide, you'll be able to experience all the content the game has to offer while ensuring you don't miss any important events or interactions.</p>
    
    <div class="important-note">
        <strong>Important Note About RNG:</strong> Many character locations and events in the game are determined by RNG (random number generation). If you don't find a character in the expected location, try leaving and re-entering the area, or return at a different time. Some locations with particularly variable character presence include the Studio, Pool, Living Room, Bedroom, and School Hallway. For events with RNG elements, the guide specifies the success rates and may require multiple attempts.

    <ul>
        <li>Click on the text when the floating line is over the yellow segment of the bar</li>

    <p>Julia's outfit score determines what she wears and where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Score of 10+: She wears the outfit everywhere during the day</li>
        <li>Score of 30+: She also wears the outfit at night</li>
        <li>Score of 50+ with latex outfit: She wears it at the pool as well</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Different outfits have different maximum scores:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily clothes: 1</li>
        <li>X-mas outfit, Black lingerie, Underwear: 20</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Sleeping Bed System</h4>

    </ul>

        <li>When John is home, Jason's bed becomes the default (until you decide John's fate in the late game)</li>
