    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the comprehensive guide for "The Twist." This detailed walkthrough provides all the information you need to progress through the game, highlighting specific interaction points, score requirements, and outcomes. Whether you're just starting your journey or looking to maximize your relationships with specific characters, this guide will help you navigate through the game efficiently.</p>
    
    <p>The guide is organized by game versions and character relationship progression, with each section detailing the specific time requirements, character interactions, item needs, and special conditions necessary to progress. By following this guide, you'll be able to experience all the content the game has to offer while ensuring you don't miss any important events or interactions.</p>
    
    <div><strong>Important Note About RNG:</strong> Many character locations and events in the game are determined by RNG (random number generation). If you don't find a character in the expected location, try leaving and re-entering the area, or return at a different time. Some locations with particularly variable character presence include the Studio, Pool, Living Room, Bedroom, and School Hallway. For events with RNG elements, the guide specifies the success rates and may require multiple attempts.</div>
