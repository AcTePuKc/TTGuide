(7) Remarks about characters
============================
- On day 60 John appears (step 350). John stays at home for 7 days and is away for 14 days. Steps with the remark (John) mean that John must be at home to do these steps.
  As long as John is at home, Janice and Julia refuse to change their clothes. With the steps 473 and 474 you decide on John's fate.
- On day 100 Danielle appears (step 271). Choose her appearance (tattoo and/or piercing or none of them).
- You can choose to let Janice or Julia visit Jason at night. Make sure Janice's score is 250 or higher, Julia's score is 260 or higher and Jason's bed is his sleeping bed.
  The last one you ask will visit Jason at night:
	a) Janice: Go to the living room and catch Janice reading a book. Click on "Talk to her" and "Ask her to visit you at night". Go to sleep in Jason's bed.
	b) Julia: Go to Julia's room when she is in there on her bed checking her phone. Click on "Ask her to visit you at night". Go to sleep in Jason's bed.
- Beginning with step 230, Jason can send text messages to Adrianna until 19:00.
  If she informs Jason to text her later, click on "Text to Adrianna" until she gives Jason a positive answer.
- Beginning with step 343, Billy can be involved in events with Janice. These steps and events have the remark (Billy) and are completely optional.
  The prerequisite for this is that you have done step 265 b.
- Beginning with step 687, Janice can get pregnant. These steps and events have the remark (Pregnancy).


(8) Sleeping bed
================
At 23:00 Jason goes to sleep. You can choose between different sleeping beds after some game progression.
Go to the respective room until 22:00 to set a bed as the default sleeping bed:

Jason's room...Jason's bed is the default sleeping bed from the beginning. When Jason's bed is not his sleeping bed:
		   Go to Jason's room, click on the bed and on "Set as sleeping bed". Jason's bed is then his sleeping bed again.
Bedroom........See step 62.
Julia's room...See step 156.

- When John is at home, Jason's bed becomes the default sleeping bed. After John leaves, you can choose Janice's or Julia's bed as the sleeping bed again.
  After you have decided on John's fate in step 474, this no longer happens.
- When Janice's bed is the sleeping bed and Janice becomes mad at Jason, Jason's bed becomes the default sleeping bed.
  After Janice is no longer mad at Jason, you can choose her bed as the sleeping bed again.


(9) Walkthrough
===============
Each of the following segments indicate the original game version and the maximum score for each female character at the end of the respective segment.
Kelly's score can be higher because her score increases by 5 by buying an item at the pharmacy shop. Her score indicates the maximum without buying the items.
