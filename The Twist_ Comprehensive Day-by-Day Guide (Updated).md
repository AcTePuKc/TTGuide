# The Twist: Comprehensive Day-by-Day Guide (Updated)

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for "The Twist." This detailed walkthrough is structured to follow the day and time progression of the game, highlighting all the specific interaction points needed to advance the storyline. Whether you're just starting your journey or looking to maximize your relationships with specific characters, this guide will help you navigate through the game efficiently.

The guide is organized chronologically, with each section detailing the specific time requirements, character interactions, item needs, and special conditions necessary to progress. By following this guide, you'll be able to experience all the content the game has to offer while ensuring you don't miss any important events or interactions.

**Important Note About RNG**: Many character locations and events in the game are determined by RNG (random number generation). If you don't find a character in the expected location, try leaving and re-entering the area, or return at a different time. Some locations with particularly variable character presence include the Studio, Pool, Living Room, Bedroom, and School Hallway. For events with RNG elements, the guide specifies the success rates and may require multiple attempts.

## Day-by-Day Walkthrough

### Early Game (Days 1-10)

#### Day 1
Your journey begins with establishing the foundational relationships and discovering key information about Jason's family situation.

**Morning/Afternoon Activities:**
Begin by exploring the house to collect important items. Go to the dining room and click on the cabinet door to the left of Jason to obtain a whisky bottle. This will be useful for an upcoming interaction with Janice. Next, head to the kitchen and click on the fridge to get a lemonade, which you'll need for a conversation with Julia later.

**15:00 or 19:00 - Conversation with Janice:**
During either of these specific time slots only, you'll find Janice drinking whisky in the dining room. Click on "Sit by the table" to initiate a conversation. Jason will give Janice the new whisky bottle you collected earlier in exchange for information about the argument she had with his dad. During this conversation, Janice will reveal the important fact that both Jason and Julia are adopted. This revelation is crucial for the storyline and opens up several conversation options with other characters.

**Evening - Informing Julia:**
Find Julia either in the living room checking her phone or sitting in the tub by the pool (both locations are RNG-based, so you may need to check both locations or leave and re-enter to find her). Click on "Sit next to her" or "Approach her" depending on her location. Jason will tell Julia about being adopted, but at this point, she won't believe him. This initial disbelief sets up future conversations where you'll need to convince her of the truth.

#### Days 2-5
During these days, focus on building your relationship with Janice through repeated interactions.

**Various Times - Increasing Janice's Score:**
There are two key repeatable scenes to increase Janice's relationship score:
1. In the kitchen, help Janice pick up the sponge when prompted (this is an RNG event that may require multiple visits to the kitchen). As Jason gets back up, he'll slide his face into Janice's crotch. This increases her score by 5 points (up to a maximum of 40).
2. Find Janice in the living room reading a book (RNG-based, may require multiple visits) and click on "massage shoulders." This increases her score by 5 points (up to a maximum of 50).

**Pool Area (When Janice is Present):**
When Janice is at the pool laying on the lounger (RNG-based, may require multiple visits), click on "Come closer" and then "Happy to!" Once Janice's score reaches at least 35, you can click on "move her leg" to increase her score by 10 points. Jason will say "Wow...nice view." Then click on "leave her be" to end the scene.

**Bedroom (20:00-22:00):**
Visit the bedroom when Janice is taking a nap (between 20:00 and 22:00 only). Click on "Get on the bed" to have Jason caress Janice's ass. There's a 50% chance that Janice will catch Jason touching her. Repeat this interaction until Jason says: "Wow! She really does have the best ass in the world!" This indicates successful completion of this interaction.

#### Day 6
Today focuses on finding evidence and convincing Julia about their adoption.

**Morning/Afternoon - Finding Janice's Panties:**
Go to the bathroom, then proceed to the jacuzzi room. Pan the camera completely down and click on Janice's panties lying on the floor. Collecting these will be useful for future interactions.

**Pool Area (When Julia is Present):**
Find Julia sitting in the tub by the pool (RNG-based, may require multiple visits) and click on "Approach her." Give Julia the lemonade you collected on Day 1 and sit next to her in the tub. During this conversation, you'll convince Julia that you are both adopted, increasing her score by 10 points. This successful conversation unlocks new scenes with Julia in the living room.

**Living Room (When Julia is Present):**
After convincing Julia about the adoption, you can catch her crying in the living room (RNG-based, may require multiple visits). Click on "Get closer" to initiate a conversation. There are two possible scenes depending on Julia's current relationship score:

1. If Julia's score is lower than 30: She'll tell Jason that her boyfriend Rick said some mean things to her. Jason will comfort and hug her, increasing her score by 5 points (up to a maximum of 30).

2. If Julia's score is 30 or higher: She'll tell Jason that her boyfriend Rick said her boobs are pathetic. After comforting and hugging her, Jason will touch her breast (with her shirt still on). There's a 50% chance to convince Julia to take her shirt off (100% chance if her score is 50 or higher), allowing Jason to touch and suck on her breast. Jason will reassure Julia that her breasts are definitely not pathetic, leading to Julia kissing Jason and thanking him for cheering her up. This increases her score by 10 points (up to a maximum of 50).

#### Day 7
Today you'll explore Julia's phone and meet Kelly at the pharmacy.

**21:00, 22:00 (or 8:00-10:00 on Weekends) - Julia's Phone:**
Go to the living room while Julia is taking a shower (only at these specific times). Click on her phone lying on the table. When prompted to enter a password, click "Cancel" for now. This sets up a future interaction where you'll learn the password.

**13:00-19:00 (Weekday) - Pharmacy Visit:**
Visit the pharmacy shop during its opening hours and click on "Go in." Choose "Talk to her" or "Call her" and then click on "Buy something." Purchase the "Suntan Lotion" as you'll need this for future interactions. After buying the lotion, click on "Back" and "Chat" to have a conversation with Kelly. During this interaction, Kelly will introduce herself to Jason, and Jason will introduce himself to Kelly, establishing this important relationship.
